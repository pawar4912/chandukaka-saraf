                                After establishing strong pillars of foundation and growing huge support from customers, it compelled us to open more jewellery retail outlets. As we are approaching the new milestone of completing a successful 196 years in the business, our clean approach helped us to extend 18 branches in Maharashtra. We have a rich heritage of serving customers; therefore, we match the pace with the trends. At present, our spacious showrooms provide a great ambience to customers’ shopping experience with the widest range of jewellery products varying from Gold, Silver, Platinum, Forming and Gemstones to Pearls, which adds value to our services. Our main focus has always remained on purity. We offer genuine BIS Hallmark certified gold products with a purity of 18, 22, 23, 23.5, & 24 karats, i.e., 99.5, whereas in India, these ornaments are being sold with a purity of 22 karats. Competing with our creative designs has also played a major role in recognising us as a symbol of purity and boosting our growth in the retail market.
